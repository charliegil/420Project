Motion estimation: Analyze the movement of objects between video frames to reduce redundant information.
Instead of storing complete information for each frame, it stores:
1. Reference frames = complete frames
2. Motion vectors = information about how blocks of pixels move between frames
3. Residual data = differences between the predicted frame and actual frame
-> This reduces the data needed to represent video (important for compression)

Block Matching Algorithm
1. The current frame is divided into blocks
2. For each block, the algorithm searches the previous frame to find the best matching block
3. It searches all blocks within a search range
4. The best match is determined by calculating the Mean Absolute Difference (MAD)
5. Create the predicted frame using best match for each block
6. Calculate residual frame by subtracting predicted frame from current frame (actual)
7. Reconstruct current frame

Observations
- If residual metric < naive residual metric, motion compensation is working
- As the block size decreases, the residual metric decreases (better motion estimation),
but the runtime increases
